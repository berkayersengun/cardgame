Card Game  

Rules of the Game:

Each player initially gets 7 cards – the remaining cards are put “face down” in a stack on the table (the hidden stack). 
The top card of the stack is turned face up next to the hidden stack. 
Each player puts down a card from his hand – this card must match the topmost open card either in suit or value – i.e. if the top card is Spade-Five a player can play any other card of suit Spade or any other suit with value Five (Club-Five, Heart-Five or Diamond-Five). 
If a player is unable to play any card, s/he is picking up a card from the hidden stack and the game moves to the next player. 
Players that pick up a card cannot play this card until it is their turn again. 
The game is finished if one of the players has no cards left on his/her hand. 
If the hidden stack is empty before any player has an empty hand, the played cards are taken, shuffled and then used as the new hidden deck.
